# 📱 Irfa App — Built from Scratch with Zero Android Knowledge (and ChatGPT as My Coding Wingman 🧠)

## 🧠 The Crazy Idea

So there I was...  
**Just a guy with a dream.**  
A dream to build a personal productivity Android app — but with **absolutely zero Android development experience**.  
No Kotlin. No Jetpack Compose. Not even XML layouts. Just vibes. 😅

But then came my trusty coding buddy — **ChatGPT** (shoutout to OpenAI 💡)  
And together, we built **Irfa** — a beautiful, useful, 100% local productivity app — in just **2 days**.  

## ⚡ What is Irfa?

Irfa is my humble attempt at organizing life with:
- A **streak tracker** to keep habits on track
- A **notes section** for all my thoughts, grocery lists, and weird reminders
- A **debt manager** because I'm broke but generous
- A **savings tracker** because… one day, I’ll be rich, insha’Allah 😇

All **offline**, **no ads**, **no internet needed** — just good ol’ productivity.

## 🧭 App Tour (with Commentary 😄)

### 🟦 Splash Screen
> **"Boom! Here's Irfa!"**

When the app launches, the word **"Irfa"** starts tiny and **zooms in dramatically**, turning the entire screen white. It's my way of saying *"I'm here!"* — and trust me, it's oddly satisfying. ⚡

---

### ✅ Tab 1: Streak Tracker  
> **Track your habits like a boss. Green = Good. Red = Try again.**

- A calendar-based view
- Tap each day: **Yes = green**, **No = red**
- Leave comments for each day if you want
- **Navigate months** to see past progress — because we don’t forget our wins (or losses 😬)

---

### 📝 Tab 2: Notes  
> **Grocery list? A quote you liked? Weird dream at 3 AM? Dump it here.**

- Tap the ➕ FAB to add a note
- View your list, scroll with ease
- Delete notes if your past self was talking nonsense

---

### 💸 Tab 3: Debt Tracker  
> **You lend 500. You borrow 700. Now you know you’re in trouble.**

- Split into two sections: **Money Given** and **Money Received**
- Add entries with:
  - Date
  - Person’s name
  - Amount
  - Optional note (like “Will pay after salary” 😅)
- Easily delete entries if someone *actually* pays you back!

---

### 💰 Tab 4: Savings Tracker  
> **For dreams like bikes, vacations, or that shawarma every Friday.**

- See your **current savings**
- Plan upcoming goals
- Mark savings as **achieved** with a tick ✔️

---

## 📦 Built With

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **Jetpack DataStore** (for offline storage — because privacy matters!)
- Endless ChatGPT prompts and unbreakable motivation 💪

---

## 📶 Internet Required?
**Nope. Nada. Nahi. Bilkul bhi nahi.**  
The entire app works offline. Your data stays on your phone. Just how it should be.

---

## ❤️ Final Thoughts

This app is proof that:
- You don't need to know everything before you start
- AI + human = unbeatable team
- If you can imagine it, you can build it. One line of Kotlin at a time.

---

## 🚀 Wanna Try It?

Clone the repo, build it in Android Studio, and run it on your device or emulator.  
Or ask me nicely, I might share the `.apk` 😄

---

## 🙏 Special Thanks

- To **ChatGPT** — you were my co-pilot, debugger, designer, and therapist through this wild ride.
- To **me**, for never giving up even when the emulator crashed for the 10th time.

Stay productive. Stay humble.
